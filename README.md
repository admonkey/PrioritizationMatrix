You can run the install script with the `--dev` flag to grab the developer tools like [PHPUnit][4].

    ./install --dev

It will use [wget][3] to download the dependency package manager [Composer v1.1.2][2].
If you do not have [wget][3], then you will need to [manually download Composer][2]
and place `composer.phar` in the project root directory.
